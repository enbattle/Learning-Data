# Perceptron Learning Algorithm

Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) takes in an n-dimensional dataset, 
and the labels (target functions) associated with classifying each 
datapoint within the that dataset. Then, it creates a learned
weight vector associated with each dimension, which will then be
used to create the line that linearly separates the datapoints. PLA
is also seen as a method of classifying different datapoints and grouping
them into two clusters (or a dichotomy). Usually, points are classified
in binary: (0 and 1) classification or (-1 and 1) classification.

For examples:
- perceptronLearningAlgorithm.py creates examples of random data points
of any number and creating a binary classification dichotomy.
- PLA_20_Points shows the dichotomy for 20 points.
- PLA_100_Points shows the dichotomy for 100 points.
- PLA_1000_Points shows the dichotomy for 1000 points.
